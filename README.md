#Idefix III ad-hoc data transfer.
The idefix-III ad hoc data transfer system is a server aimed at the secure ad-hoc transfer of data files.
Idefix-III allows the establishment of a secure channel between a sending party and a receiving web browser without 
reliance on end-to-end encryption or administrative overhead of an account based server setup. 

Idefix-III is distributed as a customized Linux server install CD ISO image. Once installed, Idefix-III is a ihighly hardened
server that should require only a minimum amount of maintenance.

The system was designed especially for use by law-enforcement, and the software itself is distributed only
to law-enforcent agencies under the conditions defined in the LICENCE file. This github repository is a place holder
aimed purely at establishing a first point of contact for aquirement of the Idefix-III distribution.

If you work for law enforcement and would like to receive a copy of the Idefix-III installation CD, please ask 
the Dutch liason to :

 * Verify your e-mail address as being law-enforcement.
 * Request the Department for Technology Development & Expertise of the Central Unit of the Dutch National Police
   to contact you about Idefix-III on that e-mail address.

Once your e-mail address is validated, we will contact you to verify that your department has understood and plans to honour the licencing, after what a copy of the idefix-III ISO will be made available to you.
